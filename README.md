# sort-images
A simple python script to sort pictures by date taken.

The only dependency is exifread, so...

```
$ pip install exifread
```

Made this to help me organize lost pictures I had to recover from a faculty backup.
Saved me a lot of hours, so maybe it may be useful to someone else.

Note that I made it specifically to fit my neeeds at the time, so you'll have to make some simple changes for it to suit you.
